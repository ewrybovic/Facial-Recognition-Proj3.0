# Facial-Recognition-Proj3.0
Facial Recognition repo for cs336
This branch has the code where dist = 1 (for FaceNet Model) which means a user will not be identified with a different person from our data. It will automatically send the user to the "Not Found" page where the user can add themselves into our data.
